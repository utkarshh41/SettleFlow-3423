[{"description":"Build a fintech web application called 'AI Collection' for B2B collections teams. Create a clean, modern fintech UI with a left sidebar navigation containing: Customers, Invoices, Tasks, and Activity sections. The Invoices section should be the primary working area. Use a professional color scheme suitable for fintech (blues, whites, subtle grays). The sidebar should highlight the active section. Include the app name 'AI Collection' with a simple logo at the top of the sidebar.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":1},{"description":"Replace the current Invoices view with a simpler Invoice Upload screen as the default view. The screen should have: 1) A prominent upload area where users can drag-and-drop or click to upload invoice PDFs or images. 2) An 'Analyze Invoice' button that triggers AI analysis. 3) After clicking analyze, show a loading state with message 'Analyzing invoice with AI...' 4) After analysis, display extracted invoice details in a clean card: Customer Name, Invoice Number, Amount (in ₹), Due Date, and Status (Draft/Sent/Overdue/Paid). 5) A 'Save Invoice' button that saves the extracted data and creates both an Invoice and Customer record. Remove filters, search, pagination, and sorting. Keep the interface minimal and focused on the upload-to-extraction flow.","type":"feature","passes":true,"id":2}]
